Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software engineering has various importance in the technology industry such as;
1. Entertainment - Software engineeing has led to the creation of software that powers streaming of shows and music such as Netflix and Spotify. These software power the entertainment industry.
2. Healthcare - Software engineering inventions have been used to sequence genes which have made significant progress in healthcare. Applications that help provide easy access to health care have also been deployed improving the sector.
3. Commerce - Banks and other financial institutions rely on software to power the flow of money electroncally. Services such as M-pesa and Sendwave are examples of such software. The stock exchange market also relies on algorithims built using software engineering.
4. Communication - Wireless communication has been heavily powered by software engineering. Examples include applications like WhatsApp and Telegram which make communication much easier.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of High level Programming Languages - Languages such as Fortran, COBOL and C made it easier to program computers as they were easier to code than assembly and machine language.
2. Establishment of software Engineeing as a Discipline in the 1960s - This led to more research and advancements in software engineering such as operating systems and the world wide web.
3. Advent of Agile methodologies of Software Development - This led to improved software which were more user focused.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements Phase - Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements for the software.
2. Design Phase - Involves designing the software and its elements such as user experience and backend functionality, according to the system requirements.
3. Implementation Phase  - Writing code to build the software as per the design.
4. Testing Phase - Involves conducting various tests on the software to ensure it meets quality and security standards.
5. Deployment Phase - This is the release of the software to the users. It may also involve obtaining feedback from the users about the software experience.
6. Maintenance Phase- Involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach to software development while agile methodology invloves an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,
  collaboration, and responding to change.

  Waterfall methodology can be used, for example, in developing a software that would help in translation in an active communication setup between people speaking different
  langages. Since the function of this software will in most cases remain the same, waterfall methodology would suffice. Agile methodologies can be used, for example, in the
  development of streaming software. Users of such software usually change their preferences which would necessitate regular iterations during and even after the development
  phase.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  1. Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures quality by designing and executing tests for the software.
  3. Project Manager - Oversees the planning execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help programmers and software developers write code in a more efficient way by providing access to tools such as compilers,
  libraries and frameworks, syntax error detectors and much more all in one place. Examples include Visual Studio (VS) Code, CodeBlocks, and PyCharm.
  Version Control refers to the practice of tracking and managing changes to software source code. It is very useful especially in collaborative software engineering as all
  developers can easily commit changes to the code from a centralised location and all developers can track these changes as well. Examples of version control tools include
  Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  1. Changing requirements - Requirements may change during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays.
  2. Tight Deadlines - Pressure to deliver software on schedule can lead to rushed work and compromised quality. 
  3. Technical Debt - These are accrued from shortcuts or sub-optimal solutions. It can impede future software development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

  Ways of overcming these challenges include;
  1. Effective communication
  2. Prioritization of tasks
  3. Employing agile methodologies
  4. Regular reassesment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  1. Unit Testing - involves testing individual components or modules of the software such as the backend functionality.
  2. Integration Testing - involves testing interations between different components such as the the front end and backend communication.
  3. System testing - involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
  4. Acceptance testing - involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

  Testing is important in quality asurance of software as it helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to hghr quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting questons or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
  Prompt engineering is important because it helps users avoid getting confusing or in the worst case scenario, wrong answers from an AI chatbot as a consciquence of giving 
  vague prompts.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague Prompt Example: 
  "Translate this: Hello! What is your name?"
  Improved Prompt:
  "Translate these English sentences to German. Hello! What is your name?"

  The improved prompt is more effective because the AI model can now provide a response that is specific to the user request, that is, translating the sentences to German.
  In the first prompt example, the AI model could have translated the sentences to a variety of languages since the user wasn't clear on which language to tanslate the
  sentences to.
